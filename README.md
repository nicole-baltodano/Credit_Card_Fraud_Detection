# **Credit Card Fraud Detection üõ°Ô∏èüí≥**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of a **neural network-based model** to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**, which contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent (highly imbalanced).

### **Goals**
- Accurately identify fraudulent transactions using a **binary classification model**.
- Address the **class imbalance problem** using techniques like **SMOTE** and **Random Undersampling**.
- Evaluate the model performance using metric **Recall**.

## **Dataset Preview**
| Feature           | Description                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Time`            | Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. |
| `V1` to `V28`     | Principal components obtained via PCA (features are anonymized).         |
| `Amount`          | Transaction amount.                                                      |
| `Class`           | Target variable (0 = Non-fraudulent, 1 = Fraudulent).                   |

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Highly imbalanced dataset**: Only ~0.17% of the transactions are fraudulent.
- **Preprocessed data**: PCA-transformed features to preserve anonymity.

## **Results**
- **Model Architecture**: A **fully connected neural network** with the following layers:
  - Input normalization layer.
  - Dense layers with **ReLU activations** and **Dropout regularization**.
  - Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

- **Metrics Evaluated**:
  - **Recall (Fraudulent Transactions)**: 70%
